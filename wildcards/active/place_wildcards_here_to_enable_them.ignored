Wildcards placed here will be read and loaded during generation.

Wildcards will insert and replace text whenever it sees the filename of a matching wildcard minus extension of the file in question, and is Case Sensitive.
Wildcards have no limit on included text and can include things such as backslashes, and will not insert text as if you'd have manually typed it.
This means that you can randomly set emphasis or custom prompt editing features using this.
